# MPM-Plasma-Torch
Implementing the Material Point Method (MPM) for simulating many particles in a hot gas flow in C++ involves severals steps.
The MPM is a numerical technique that combines the advantages of both Eulerian and Lagrangian methods, making it suitable for handling large deformations 
and complex intercations such as thos found in fluid and solid mechanics.
